"""Masked diffusion language model (dLLM) support for RL training.

Implements the sequence-level ELBO likelihood used by GDPO, "Improving
Reasoning for Diffusion Language Models via Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization", ICLR 2026 (https://openreview.net/forum?id=JaqvespRBP,
https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08554). Not to be confused with
``grpo.adv_estimator.name = "gdpo"``, which is the unrelated multi-reward
estimator from https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05242.
