r"""Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo (SDMC) ELBO estimation for masked diffusion LMs.

Masked diffusion LMs admit no exact sequence likelihood, so GDPO
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08554) substitutes the ELBO

.. math::
    \mathcal{L}(y|q) = \int_0^1 \mathbb{E}_{y_t}\left[\frac{1}{t}
        \sum_i \mathbf{1}[y_t^i = M] \log \pi_\theta(y^i | y_t, q)\right] dt

The paper's contribution is *how* this integral is approximated: sampling ``t``
at random dominates the estimator variance, so the time integral is instead
evaluated with a deterministic quadrature rule and only the inner masking
expectation is left to Monte Carlo -- hence "semi-deterministic". Two or three
quadrature points match a 100+ sample double-Monte-Carlo estimator.

This module is deliberately free of any model or parallelism concern. It emits
the masked inputs to score (:meth:`SdmcElboEstimator.mask_points`) and folds the
resulting log probabilities back into a per-position tensor
(:meth:`SdmcElboEstimator.accumulate`); the caller owns the forward passes. The
per-position form is what lets the rest of NeMo RL stay unchanged -- it occupies
the same ``[batch, seq_len]`` slot as autoregressive token log probabilities, and
its masked sum is the scalar ELBO the GDPO objective needs.
